      <p className="text-lg max-w-2xl leading-relaxed">
        Iâ€™m Abenezer Dehene (Jack), a 4th year Mechanical Engineering student and full-stack developer with
        3+ years of experience.
        <br /><br />
        I specialize in building responsive mobile apps using Flutter and scalable APIs using Node.js, NestJS,
        and PostgreSQL. I care deeply about clean architecture, high-performance code, and shipping work that
        matters.
        <br /><br />
        From backend logic to frontend polish, I work fast, deliver clean, and think big.
